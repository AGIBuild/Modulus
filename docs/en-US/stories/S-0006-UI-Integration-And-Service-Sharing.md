# S-0006-UI-Integration-And-Service-Sharing

## User Story
As a plugin developer, I want plugins to deeply integrate with the main program UI, supporting custom main views, menu bar extensions, and secure service and log sharing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Plugins can provide main view controls through IPlugin.GetMainView(), adapting to the main program theme
- Plugins can extend the main program menu bar through IPlugin.GetMenu()
- Plugin UI controls need to follow the main program's style and behavior conventions
- Plugins can securely share services through dependency injection (with permission constraints)
- Plugin logs can be injected through ILogger<T>, supporting level filtering and namespace isolation
- Plugin logs can output to files, debug windows, and remote services

## Technical Tasks
- [ ] Design UI extension points and interface
- [ ] Implement main view integration mechanism
- [ ] Implement menu extension system
- [ ] Design service sharing architecture (with security constraints)
- [ ] Implement plugin logging system
- [ ] Create UI extension documentation and examples
