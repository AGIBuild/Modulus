# S-0002-Unified-Build-System

## User Story
As a developer, I want the main program and plugin projects to be built, debugged, and packaged through a unified Nuke script, simplifying multi-platform development workflow.

## Priority Note
This Story has the highest current development priority (P0) and needs to be implemented first.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Nuke script supports `nuke run`: Run the main program (configurable project path)
- Nuke script supports `nuke build`: Compile the main program and all plugin projects
- Nuke script supports `nuke pack`: Package the main program and plugins as independent artifacts (such as zip, nupkg, etc.)
- Nuke script supports `nuke clean`: Clean all build artifacts
- Nuke script supports multiple platforms (Windows/macOS)
- Nuke script can be extended to support CI/CD integration
- Build logs are clear, with failure notifications

## Technical Tasks
- [x] Build initialization: Add Nuke execution environment
- [x] Script implementation: Implement the main build/run/pack/clean tasks
- [x] Multi-platform support: Ensure scripts work on both Windows and macOS
- [x] Plugin discovery: Support auto-finding plugin projects
- [x] Build optimization: Add output caching and dependency management
- [x] CI/CD Integration: Prepare for CI/CD integration
- [x] VS/VSCode integration: Add debugging and task configuration
