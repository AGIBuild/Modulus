# S-0005-Plugin-Configuration-And-Localization

## User Story
As a plugin developer, I want plugins to easily support localization and configuration management, with the main program able to dynamically pass parameters and override configurations, and plugins able to automatically adapt to multiple language environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Plugins can carry independent pluginsettings.json configuration files
- Plugins support automatically reading configuration through injected IConfiguration
- Main program can dynamically pass parameters and override plugin configurations
- Plugins can carry lang.xx.json localization resources, supporting multiple languages
- Plugins access translation entries through the ILocalizer interface
- Plugin localization can automatically switch based on system language or user settings

## Technical Tasks
- [ ] Design plugin configuration model and pipeline
- [ ] Implement configuration loading and merging logic
- [ ] Implement mechanism for main program to override plugin configurations
- [ ] Design localization file format and loading strategy
- [ ] Implement ILocalizer interface and core service
