# S-0003-Plugin-Loading-And-Isolation

## User Story
As a main program developer, I want the main program to have plugin loading and isolation capabilities, able to dynamically discover, load, and unload plugins, and provide each plugin with an independent runtime environment and debugging capabilities, in order to support plugin hot reloading and secure sandboxing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Support automatic plugin discovery from a plugin directory (plugin directory should be located in the user directory, such as `%USERPROFILE%/.modulus/plugins` or `~/.modulus/plugins`, not in the software installation directory)
- Support dynamic loading and unloading of plugins; the main program should not need to restart to add or remove plugins
- Plugins are loaded in isolation through AssemblyLoadContext, not interfering with each other
- Each plugin can run and be debugged independently; the main program can start/stop individual plugins
- Support plugin hot reloading (automatically reload after replacing dll)
- Plugins run in a sandbox environment with limited access rights to the main program and system
- Plugin exceptions/crashes do not affect the main program and other plugins

## Technical Tasks
- [x] Design plugin isolation architecture, using AssemblyLoadContext
- [x] Implement plugin discovery mechanism (from the fixed directory and scanning)
- [x] Implement plugin loading/unloading core logic
- [x] Implement plugin sandbox model and security constraints
- [x] Implement hot reloading mechanism with file system monitoring
- [x] Add plugin debugging support (for IDE integration)
- [x] Exception handling and logging for plugin failures
- [x] Create plugin lifecycle documentation
