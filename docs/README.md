## Images and Resources

Common images and resources used across documentation are stored in the [Images](./Images) directory.

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to the documentation:

1. Add new content to the appropriate language section
2. Maintain consistent formatting and style
3. Add images to the common images directory
4. Update the relevant README files when adding new documents

## Documentation Updates

As of May 2025, we have reorganized the documentation into a language-based structure. All documentation is now organized by language (en-US or zh-CN) and then by type (user guides, developer guides, and stories). The old structure has been retired.
